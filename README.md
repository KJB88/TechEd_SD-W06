  <h2>📋 Project Outline</h2>
  <p>
    It's time for some more cookies. Re-create the Cookie Clicker game from previous weeks as a React application. It's useful to build the same application in the new paradigm so you can draw direct comparisons and see how the new approach is different from the old one.
  </p>

  <p>
    React requires a slightly different way of thinking than plain HTML and JavaScript, but it's the same technologies under the hood. The main differences are - surprise, surprise - in the way what is being displayed by your components reacts to changes in the data, rather than manually updating the DOM ourselves.

    <b>All requirements and stretch goals are underway! No specific difficulties so far.</b>

  <h2>🙍 User Stories</h2>
  <h3>As a User, I would like to...</h3>
  <ul>
    <li>...be able to click the cookie and increment the counter.</li>
    <li>...see the counter automatically increment using an interval timer.</li>
    <li>...purchase items i can afford in the shop and increase the number of cookies every time the interval passes.</li>
  </ul>
</section>
<section>
<h2>👷 Requirements</h2>
  <ul>
    <li>Create state variables to store the current number of cookies and the cookies PerSecond value (useState)</li>
    <li>Set up a timer to increment the number of cookies by the cookiesPerSecond value (useEffect). Be sure to handle clearing the timer using the useEffect return value.</li>
    <li>Set up an array of objects containing the items available for purchase in the store, their cost and their increment increase value. Map through these and create buttons for each.</li>
    <li>Create a function to handle the purchase of an item. This should check if the user has enough cookies to purchase the item, and if so, subtract the cost of the item from the number of cookies and add the increment value to the cookiesPerSecond value.</li>
  </ul>
</section>
<section>
<h2>🥅 Stretch Goals</h2>
  <ul>
    <li>Store the cookies and cookiesPerSecond values in localStorage so they persist between page refreshes.</li>
  </ul>
